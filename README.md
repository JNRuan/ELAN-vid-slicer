# ELAN Vid Slicer

**Author**: James Nguyen, University of Queensland

The ELAN Vid Slicer is a tool created to perform a data pre-processing task involving annotated Elan (.eaf) files and video recordings of Auslan signers. This tool allows you to extract frames from a recording based on important annotations detected at a transcription tier within Elan (.eaf) files.

For now this is a command line tool, a full gui is a stretch goal.
